Vulnerability: Stack Buffer Overflow via Profile name
The profile name is limited to 10 bytes, but the string length/size is unchecked. Using an excessive long profile name will cause a stack smash and overwrite the return addres (known as $ra)


0xB0 = $ra control offset in save game
0xC0 = Location of the injected binary
0x08000000 + 0x011051E0 = 0x091051E0: payload address [E0 51 10 09]
